This suggests that the culture being represented is predominantly Chinese. While other Asian cultures, such as Indonesian and Malaysian, also have Chinese communities and use Chinese characters in their language, the overall atmosphere of the image appears to be more distinctively Chinese.

The architecture of the buildings, with their traditional Chinese features like tile roofs and ornate decorations, further supports this conclusion. Additionally, the presence of Chinese characters on street signs and advertisements indicates a strong Chinese influence on the city's culture and daily life.
